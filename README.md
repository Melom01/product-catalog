- **FPDart** for functional programming
- **Cubit + Bloc** as state management
- **Dio** as HTTP client
- **GetIt** for the dependency injection

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### IMPORT SORTER
To run the import sorter type:
```shell
flutter pub run import_sorter:main
```

### BUILD RUNNER
To run the build runner and generate auto-code (e.g. JSON serializer) type:
```shell
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### TESTS
To run all the tests:
```shell
flutter test
```
